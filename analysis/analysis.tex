\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

% Edge inference was performed on a few different graphs where the true gold standard edges are known. Node values are then simulated using these known graphs using two different methods. The node values represent the RNA log fold-change values found experimentally. By inferring the edges using the simulated node values we evaluate the performance of edge inference. Lastly, the experimental yeast data is applied for edge inference for protein kinase interactions, while transcription factor interactions are assumed known.

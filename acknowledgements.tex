\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Jotun Hein for taking me on for a project, for being highly engaged throughout my entire time at Oxford, and for taking an interest in bringing me into his academic environment, for instance with high table formals. Jotun and I read and discussed a wide range of article, covering relevant fields, which gave great insight the landscape of related works. I appreciate Jotun's commitment to inclusion by inviting me to reading groups, talks, such as the talks on "Protein Day", as well as teaching me in his course "Statistical Genetics and Bioinformatics" at the Doctoral Training Centre.
I gained much experience in communicating the progression of my project at the weekly group presentations, where Jotun's other students were presenting their own work as well. For this I would like to thank Jotun's other students for taking a keen interest in my project and asking helpful questions. Lastly, I would like to thank Christopher Workman for his great insight and intuition in the world of gene regulation and protein interactions, and for putting forward the problem initially. I also appreciate that Christopher took me on, first with an initial special course, and then helping me secure a Master's Thesis project, as well as securing me computational resources at Computerome, allowing me to organize large amounts of data and to run heavy code.

\section{Data}
% The data used for in-silico experiments are relative RNA expression levels describing how transcription levels are affected by different experimental conditions of gene manipulation, such as gene deletions (knockouts). Protein-protein interaction data is also used describing direct protein regulation, as well as protein-DNA interaction describing transcriptional control.

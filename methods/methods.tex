\section{Methods}

% A few different methods of edge inference on regulatory networks were tested. Most of the code is available at the Bitbucket repository~(\url{https://bitbucket.org/Degnbol/knocknet/}). \texttt{Knocknet} is an interactive command-line environment providing access to most of the functions used in this work, such as basic array operations, simulation of gene regulation and inference of network structures. Some code used is provided in the same repository as independent command-line scripts, such as for plotting and computing which nodes have detectable outgoing edges~(\autoref{sec:unobservable}).
